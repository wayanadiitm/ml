**WAYANAD HOUSE ML SERIES**

**Module: Pythonic Sprint for Python Beginners**

There will be **3 tasks released on 2nd Oct, 3rd Oct and 4th Oct.** This will be a mix of auto-graded MCQs, SATQs and a few LATQs which will be manually evaluated. Hints and documentation will be provided wherever necessary. Objective is to test logical reasoning instead of theoretical knowledge or memorisation.

These tasks will be **due on 6th Oct, 7th Oct and 8th Oct respectively.**

There will be an **additional bonus hands-on activity** that needs to be done in Google Colab repository. This will be scheduled for only those who fall short of the cut-off points for appreciation OR the minimum participation% cut-off after task-3. Date: 13th Oct 2024\.

**Cut-off/Minimum Requirements**

- 75% for Appreciation (including bonus points if applicable)  
- At least 2 tasks need to be submitted (including bonus activity if applicable)

**Milestones**

**1\. At least 2 out of the first 3 tasks submitted?**

**YES:** Eligible for Participation certificate (now, move to rule 2\)

**NO, Just 1 submitted:** Will be allowed to take bonus hands-on activity, if attempted, will get Participation cert.

**NO, None submitted:** Won’t be eligible for participation cert/bonus attempt.

2\. **Eligible for Participation certificate?**

**YES, total points\>=75% (till task-3 combined):** Eligible for Appreciation cert.

**YES, but total points\<75% (till task-3 combined):** Will be allowed to take bonus hands-on activity  
If attempted, will get Appreciation cert provisional to final points\>=75% after considering bonus scores (if points achieved \>75, it will be considered/capped as/at 75 only since this is a 2nd chance to maximize the points).

If not attempted OR final points\<75% even after considering bonus score, Participation certificate will be the final status.

**Understanding the bonus scoring**

One activity with 2 sub-tasks (1 point each)

Say, you secured 10.25/14 points (from the 14 problems in tasks 1-3) & got a score of 73.21 (final score ceiled to 74%) i.e. Participation certificate.

Now, if you do both the bonus activity perfectly and get 2 points, we will add this directly to your secured points out of 14 → your score becomes max(14,10.25+2) i.e. 12.25/14 → **final** **score becomes 88 (to be capped at 75\) from 74** → you now get an appreciation certificate\!
